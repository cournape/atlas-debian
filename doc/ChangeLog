ATLAS 3.8.3 released 02/18/09, changes from 3.8.2:
   * New architectures, arch-specific kernels, and configure support:
     - Changed Core2Duo arch to simply Core2
       + New kernels backported from 3.9.x for Core2 substantially increase
         Core2 performance
       + New arch defs for all Core2 archs
     - Added recognition of Corei7 architecture
       + Added arch defs which presently use new Core2-tuned kernels
     - Added new K10h kernel
       - Updated 64-bit arch defs to use it
   * Fixed bugs:
     - Fixed archinfo_x86 to always use extended family type (new usage)
     - Fixed mass typo for archinfo_freebsd
     - Fixed flag quotes for Make.mvtune
     - Fixed error causing GEMM to get wrong answer if K=3 on MIPS arch
     - Added additional workarounds for gcc's solaris_x86 division bug
     - Fixed bug in TRSM tuning
ATLAS 3.8.2 released 06/06/08, Changes from 3.8.1:
   * Fixed bugs:
     - Pervasive performance bug in GEMM, affecting all architectures
     - Occasional access of C when BETA=0
   * Configure improvements:
     - Improved freebsd architecture probe
     - Improved linux cpu throttling probe
     - Added Itanium 2 detection as "McKinley" in archinfo_linux
   * Added cleanup for 4x1 case for 64-bit sgemm (almost doubles LAPACK 'Upper' 
     Cholesky performance -- ATLAS Cholesky is fast without this fix)
   * Added mu=4 SSE M cleanup for extra performance
ATLAS 3.8.1 released 02/22/08, Changes from 3.8.0:
   * Fixed bug in slvtst that counted complex flops same as real
   * Fixed bug causing wrong answer for row-major gemm C=A*A' or A'A 
   * Fixed bug in configure causing Pentium-M to be IDed as CoreDuo
   * Fixed bug in tfc.c causing memory overwrite when too many samples taken
   * Improved L1 BLAS timers so they work like the rest of the package, and
     thus don't die all the time on tolerance failures
   * Improved ATLAS/tune/blas/gemm/mmsearch.c:
     - for x86, tried more registers, since smart compiler can reduce A & B
       regs to 2 (and possibly even 1)
     - Made it so search tries both load-C-at-top and load-C-at-bottom of
       M loop.  Bottom is superior for error, and ATLAS originally defaulted
       to load-C-at-top.
   * Added configure support for new K10h platform from AMD, as well as
     basic architectural defaults (no new kernels, just good search)

ATLAS 3.8.0 released 10/10/07, changes from 3.6.0:
   * Improved installation support: now works with 5-step standard install:

     - Support for building dynamic (shared) libraries
     - Can build in any directory
   * Added detailed installation guide (ATLAS/doc/atlas_install.pdf), 
     indicating how to build ATLAS, as well as describing how you can
     ensure that the produced libraries get adequate performance as well
     as the correct answers.
   * Improved GEMM performance on most platforms:
     - HAMMER (Opteron/Athlon-64), P4, P4E, Core2Duo, CoreDuo, MIPS,
       G5/PowerPC970, POWER4, POWER5, etc.
     - Better handling of long-thin matrices (K >> M,N) and rank-K, K<=4 shapes
     - Improved complex performance on some platforms
     - Further reduced error on some platforms 
       + ATLAS error bound always <= reference BLAS before reduction

ATLAS 3.7.33 released 05/01/07, changes from 3.7.32:
   * Made it so ATLAS builds on Solaris x86:
     - Had to remove all constant divides in integer expressions in assembly,
       as Sun geniuses decided to change comment character to '/'
       + \/ is supposed to work, but doesn't
     - Had to touch every x86 assembly file to change assembly comments to /**/
ATLAS 3.7.32 released 04/27/07, changes from 3.7.31:
   * Adapted MIPS double prec kernel to single
   * Added 32-bit support (n32) to MIPS (assembly & config)
   * Ported UltraSPARC assembly kernels used by arch defs to v9 ABI
   * Added arch defs to build 64 bit (v9) ABI for Solarix/UltraSPARC

ATLAS 3.7.31 released 04/17/07, changes from 3.7.30:
   * Fixed bug in atlas_prefetch found by David Cournapeau.
   * Added MIPSICE9 prefetch option, d/zgemm assembly kernels and arch defaults.
     - These should work on most MIPS platforms 
     - Assembly kernels work under IRIX, but no way to get cc to do prefetch
       + could not make cc's pragma work with ATLAS's atlas_prefetch defs
   * Added support for OSX/PowerPC970:
     - Double precision assembly kernel getting 82.5% of peak (4*Mhz)
     - Single precision assembly kernel getting 79% of peak (8*Mhz)

     - fixed dynamic lib link for f77 interface libs
     - Updated L1 kernel testers in tune/ for function routs to call the test
       func first (so correct answer not on stack), and to check for NaN
     - Fixed it so error report genned again.
     - Fixed error causing real JITcp to copy all the time, and then fixed
       error in func ptr when this was selected.
   * Wrote special Just In Time Copy (JITcp) gemm for complex that copies A&B
     a block at a time, and calls the real kernel for complex matmul
     - Speeds up large-case z/cgemm on some platforms (5-10%)
     - Speeds up long-K case for some platforms (as much as doubles perf)
   * Fixed miscalculation of CacheEdge, where I stopped using it for large K.
     This fix reduces memory usage, and speeds up asymptotic case a bit.
ATLAS 3.7.29 released 02/28/07, changes from 3.7.28:
   * Wrote special routines (mmBPP and mmMNK) for handling small M, N and 
     large K case.  For M = N <= NB can double performance.  Presently works
     for real precisions (s,d) only.
   * Translated x87 Athlon-64 kernel to 32-bit assembly.
   * Put in special code to handle SYRK call to GEMM by calling SYRK and
     reflecting the triangular matrix.  Doubles speed, and avoid fp error
     on reflection.

     - Can specify flags to be appended to gcc in user-contributed index files
     - Can append flags to only C compilers
     - Can append flags to only C+usergcc, all+usergcc, etc.
   * Configure now recognizes gnu compilers as gnu compiler regardless of
     compiler name when looking for default flags for user-override compilers
ATLAS 3.7.26 released 01/30/07, changes from 3.7.25:
   * Added line to all assembly files to declare them as not requiring an
     executable stack for Linux (apparently, lack broke SELinux).
   * Numerous assembly fixes, particularly forced use of .text and asmdecor
     in all x86 assembly files.
   * Fixed dnrm2's to call sqrtl to avoid gcc round-down.
ATLAS 3.7.25 released 01/22/07, changes from 3.7.24:
   * Added x87 nrm2 assembly kernels to avoid gcc probs, changed old 
     gcc-compiled nrm21 kernels to use double native precision for
     accumulator (breaks dnrm2 due to gcc's spurious round-down).
   * Changed Athlon64 and Core2Duo arch defaults to use load-at-bottom gemm
     kernels, which should reduce GEMM error
   * Changed configure to error out if ran in ATLAS source directory.
   * Changed all ATLAS/doc postscript files to .pdf

ATLAS 3.7.21 released 11/18/06, changes from 3.7.20:
   * Made gemm call axpy-based GEMM when K < 4 && M >= 40 and
     no-copy code would be used -- should help bottom of LU recursion perf
   * Changed it so all F2C probes linked by Fortran do all I/O in Fortran,
     instead of printing from C (some platforms seem to have problems
     redirecting C I/O from a Fortran-linked program).
   * Several bug fixes
   * Added config support for solaris install
ATLAS 3.7.20 released 11/11/06, changes from 3.7.19:
   * Added ability to use Cij = instead of Cij += on first iteration of loop
     in emit_mm.c:
     - Max K unrolling where this is done is set by cpp macro MAX_CASG_KU
       to avoid code bloat (always works for full unroll)
     - For muladd=1, doesn't work if K is unknown at compile-time
     - Speeds up load-at-bottom and beta=0 code
   * Added ability to prefetch C when prefA selected and doing load-at-bottom
     or beta=0.  Gives nice speedup on HammerX2, need to test other machines
   * Added -falign-loops=4 to x87-using flags 
     - big speedup on Hammer, need to test on Intel
   * Several bug fixes to allow config/install to work on OSX/Core2Duo:
     - Fixed userindex so that it substitutes $(GOODGCC) for gcc in .SSE & .3DN
       files as well as in .flg
     - Made user override of 64 bits switch the probed assembly if it was
       probed to be x8632
     - Fixed freebsd archinfo syntax error (typo in code that fixed overflow).

     - Replaced binary constant with hex in Core2Duo gemm kernel
     - For portability, rewrote saxpy_sse.c to avoid indirect jumps
ATLAS 3.7.19 released 10/14/06, changes from 3.7.18:
   * Fixed config so it defines [S,D]MAFLAGS, and changed muladd probe
     to use them
   * Fixed a couple more assembly files to work with OS X
   * User can now successfully override 32/64 bit choice on the configure
     line using -b [32,64].

       is overridden by the user on the configure line
     - Fixed error in userflag.c
     - Fixed lack of ' ' around C compiler names in GEMM files
     - After probes finished in config, made 32-bit override change detected
       asmb to 32 if it was presently 64
ATLAS 3.7.18 released 10/12/06, changes from 3.7.17:
   * Bugfix release only:
     - Fixed configure so that multiple compiler flags can be passed to config.
     - Adapted x86 assembly kernels in Level 1 & src directories so that they
       will also run under OS X
     - Added needed #define to ATLAS/src/invtst.c
     - Added fix to disambiguate int & long in f77/C interface
ATLAS 3.7.17 released 09/09/06, changes from 3.7.16:
   * Added ability to generate non-diagonally dominant positive definite
     matrices to Cholesky-based testers if POSDEFGEN is defined

   * Added architectural defaults for Core2Duo64SSE3
     - Hand-tuned cases not yet optimized; presently using P4-tuned kernels
   * Made "make install" allow copy of fortran interface to fail w/o dying
     (for users w/o fortran compiler)
ATLAS 3.7.15 released 08/22/06, changes from 3.7.14:
   * New x87 kernel that achieves over 90% of peak for double precision
     Opteron/Athlon-64.  Gemm runs at roughly same speed as old SSE kernel,
     but LU and Cholesky actually get a speedup.  The fp stack usage
     of this kernel was suggested by the new gcc.
     - New arch defaults for HAMMER64SSE[2,3]
   * Modified ILEANV so small problems aren't told to use the full ATLAS NB.

     - Made "make build" delete all config executables
     - Added --nof77 to configure
     - Added "make check" as sanity test instead of "make test"

       -- Alias not working, need to check!
     - Fixed error in -Si nof77 1, which caused config to die w/o f77 compiler
   * Added new arch defaults for P4E[32,64]SSE3 and HAMMER64SSE3, which get
     better performance for gcc 4.2 (perf should still be OK for gcc 3).
ATLAS 3.7.13 released 07/26/06, changes from 3.7.12:
   * Mainly, fixes/updates to ATLAS config:

   * Completely rewrote configure handling to make ATLAS act more like
     gnu configure
     - You now build ATLAS in an arbitrary build directory
       + /path/to/ATLAS/configure ; make build ; make test
     - Read ATLAS/INSTALL.txt for directions, everything is changed!
     - Presently, only supported OSes are Linux and FreeBSD (OSX). 
       Will be adding more in subsequent developer releases.
   * Added support for prefetch in generator, mmsearch.c, fc.c, etc.

     - Added prefetch searching
     - Updated FindMUNU to suggest 1-D vals on x86 boxes (2-op assembler).
     - Made sure GetNO1D always returns false for x86 boxes (2-op assembler)
     - Added special case for large number of registers (eg. Itanium) to
       speed up munu search (searches near-square only)
       + Untested, and likely needs fixing
     - several small error-handling issues
   * Improved masearch.c & L1CacheSize.c to make loop-removal by compiler
     less likely.
