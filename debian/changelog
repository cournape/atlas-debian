  * Rework shlibs and shlibdeps processing to ensure that there are no
    self depends in library packages -- Closes: #277589.  The solution
    taken here is to make the shlibs files in the standard fashion with
    dh_makeshlibs, edit the entries to reflect the reference and virtual
    alternatives, run dh_shlibdeps -a against atlas3-base for robustness,
    rerun on library packages only using the shlibs in each package to
    resolve its own dependencies, then finally rewrite the shlibs files to
    refer to atlas3-base as the first virtual alternative in all files for
    consistency.
  * Fix atlas3-altivec.config, Closes: #277600.  FIXME -- cpu, cpu model,
    and cpu family need systematization.

    in xduumtst for now.  FIXME.  Perhaps Jan-Jaap van der Heijden
    <J.J.vanderHeijden@home.nl> can help?

    and lapack.

atlas (2.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed toplevel Makefiles to allow proper compilation on generic
    platforms.  As found on netlib, atlas has an interactive build
    process.  A custom 'config' program is compiled and run, which prompts
    the user for certain information, and writes the toplevel Makefiles.
    This procedure doesn't fit well with automated building under Debian,
    so a (pair of) generic Makefiles has been provided for compilation on
    Debian systems.  Some fields were inadvertantly left in these files
    which pertain to the specific hardware of this maintainer, making
    building on some machines impossible.  This update should allow for
    proper building on all Debian systems.  Furthermore, these Makefiles
    have been verified to produce libraries with essentially the same
    performance on the matintainer's hardware. In the future, perhaps the
    proper way to do this is to run the atlas config program under some
    special shell, like 'expect'.  This would in addition require
    automated editing of these files by debian/rules.
